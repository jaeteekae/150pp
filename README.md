-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems we have solved:

	Simple Distribution and Probability Questions:
		A: trivial time

	Dice and Coins:
		F: trivial time

	Tally-sheet Questions:
		N: 
		O: 
		For both of these questions, we hit combinatorics, and thus we do not 
		know how long these problems will take.


	Gambling Question:
		We hit combinatorics with these problems.
		We have figured out the expected money that the guesser and thrower can
		expect to win.
